# IrisDataset
The regression model evaluation system is designed to read configuration details from a JSON file, preprocess the data, and train multiple regression models. It then evaluates the models based on various metrics and provides insights into their performance.

## Prerequisites
To run this code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.9)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- striprtf

## Approach
The evaluation system follows these steps:
- Parse JSON Configuration
- Feature Reduction
- Initialize Models
- Train Models using GridSearchCV 
- Evaluate Models
- Display Results
